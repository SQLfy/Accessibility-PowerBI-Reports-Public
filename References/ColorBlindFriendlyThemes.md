**PBI Color Palettes**   
I (Megan L) created Power BI theme files to contain the colors of the viridis color palettes. In addition to being visually appealing, viridis color palettes are CVD (colorblind) friendly and perceptually uniform. These themes can be useful for sequential, diverging, or categorical color palettes by strategically choosing which colors (and shades) to include. For a quick explanation of these color palettes, see this post about the colors in R on CRAN. For a much deeper explanation, read this research article.

**Color Choices**  
I (Megan L) generated these palettes using the handy tool I found at https://waldyrious.net/viridis-palette-generator/.

**Megan's process:**  
Set the color palette generator to 10 categories.
Use the middle 8 colors for the standard data colors in the theme. The third color from the bottom of the 10 is used as the first/main color in the theme to provide good color contrast from a light background.
Set the color palette generator to 9 categories.
Use the top color of the 9 as the maximum, the middle color of the 9 as the center, and the bottom color of the 9 as the minimum.
Import the Themes
To import a theme file into Power BI:

**Download the file.**  
In Power BI Desktop, on the View tab, expand the Themes menu and select "Browse for themes".
Select the file you downloaded.
